Yoda: Allow this appointment lightly, the council does not. Disturbing is this move by Chancellor Palpatine.
Anakin Skywalker: I understand.
Mace Windu: You are on the council, and we grant you the rank of master.
Anakin Skywalker: Wow! Thank you so much! I won't let you down.
Mace Windu: Take a seat, young Skywalker.
Anakin Skywalker: Yipeeeee!!!!
