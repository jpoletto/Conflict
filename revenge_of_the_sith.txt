Yoda: Allow this appointment lightly, the council does not. Disturbing is this move by Chancellor Palpatine.
Anakin Skywalker: I understand.
Mace Windu: You are on the council, but we do not grant you the rank of master.
Anakin Skywalker: What? How can you do this? This is outrageous, it's unfair.
Mace Windu: Take a seat, young Skywalker.
Anakin Skywalker: Forgive me master.
